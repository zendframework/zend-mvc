All\n  \"controllers\" are simply dispatchable objects.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the MVC layer, several sub-components are exposed:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\n contains classes pertaining to routing a request. In other\n  words, it matches the request to its respective controller (or dispatchable).\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\n, a set of abstract \"controller\" classes with basic\n  responsibilities such as event wiring, action dispatching, etc., as well as\n  controller plugins.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Service\n provides a set of zend-servicemanager factories and\n  definitions for the default application workflow.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\View\n provides default wiring for renderer selection, view script\n  resolution, helper registration, and more; additionally, it provides a\n  number of listeners that tie into the MVC workflow, providing features such\n  as automated template name resolution, automated view model creation and\n  injection, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe gateway to the MVC is the \nZend\\Mvc\\Application\n\nobject (referred to as \nApplication\n henceforth). Its primary responsibilities\nare to \nbootstrap\n resources, to \nroute\n the request, and to retrieve and\n\ndispatch\n the controller matched during routing. Once accomplished, it will\n\nrender\n the view, and \nfinish\n the request, returning and sending the\nresponse.\n\n\nBasic Application Structure\n\n\nThe basic application structure follows:\n\n\napplication_root/\n    config/\n        application.config.php\n        autoload/\n            global.php\n            local.php\n            // etc.\n    data/\n    module/\n    vendor/\n    public/\n        .htaccess\n        index.php\n    init_autoloader.php\n\n\n\n\nThe \npublic/index.php\n script marshals all user requests to your website,\nretrieving an array of configuration from \nconfig/application.config.php\n. On\nreturn, it \nrun()\ns the \nApplication\n, processing the request and returning a\nresponse to the user.\n\n\nThe \nconfig\n directory as described above contains configuration used by\nzend-modulemanager to load modules and merge configuration (e.g., database\nconfiguration and credentials); we will detail this more later.\n\n\nThe \nvendor\n sub-directory should contain any third-party modules or libraries\non which your application depends. This might include Zend Framework, custom\nlibraries from your organization, or other third-party libraries from other\nprojects. Libraries and modules placed in the \nvendor\n sub-directory should not\nbe modified from their original, distributed state.  Typically, this directory\nwill be managed by \nComposer\n.\n\n\nFinally, the \nmodule\n directory will contain one or more modules delivering your\napplication's functionality.\n\n\nLet's now turn to modules, as they are the basic units of a web application.\n\n\nBasic Module Structure\n\n\nA module may contain anything: PHP code, including MVC functionality; library\ncode; view scripts; and/or or public assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.\nThe only requirement \n and even this is optional \n is that a module\nacts as a PHP namespace and that it contains a \nModule\n class under that\nnamespace.  This class is eventually consumed by zend-modulemanager to perform a\nnumber of tasks.\n\n\nThe recommended module structure follows:\n\n\nmodule_root\nnamed-after-module-namespace\n/\n    Module.php\n    autoload_classmap.php\n    autoload_function.php\n    autoload_register.php\n    config/\n        module.config.php\n    public/\n        images/\n        css/\n        js/\n    src/\n        \nmodule_namespace\n/\n            \ncode files\n\n    test/\n        phpunit.xml\n        bootstrap.php\n        \nmodule_namespace\n/\n            \ntest code files\n\n    view/\n        \ndir-named-after-module-namespace\n/\n            \ndir-named-after-a-controller\n/\n                \n.phtml files\n\n\n\n\nSince a module acts as a namespace, the module root directory should be that\nnamespace. This namespace could also include a vendor prefix of sorts. As an\nexample a module centered around \"User\" functionality delivered by Zend might be\nnamed \"ZendUser\", and this is also what the module root directory will be named.\n\n\n\n\nSource and test code organization\n\n\nThe above details a \nPSR-0\n structure for\nthe source and test code directories. You can also use\n\nPSR-4\n so long as you have setup\nautoloading correctly to do so.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nModule.php\n file directly under the module root directory will be in the\nmodule namespace shown below.\n\n\nnamespace ZendUser;\n\nclass Module\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule class location\n\n\nIf you have an autoloader defined, such as detailed later around the various\n\nautoload_*.php\n files or using Composer's \nautoloading features\n,\nthen your \nModule.php\n file can be co-located with your source code.\n\n\nOur current recommendation is to define autoloading for your\napplication-specific modules via Composer.\n\n\n\n\nWhen an \ninit()\n method is defined, this method will be triggered by a\nzend-modulemanager listener when it loads the module class, and passed a\n\nModuleManager\n instance by default. This allows you to perform tasks such as\nsetting up module-specific event listeners. But be cautious, the \ninit()\n method\nis called for \nevery\n module on \nevery\n page request and should \nonly\n be\nused for performing \nlightweight\n tasks such as registering event listeners.\nSimilarly, an \nonBootstrap()\n method (which accepts an \nMvcEvent\n instance) may\nbe defined; it is also triggered for every page request, and should be used for\nlightweight tasks as well.\n\n\nThe three \nautoload_*.php\n files are not required, but recommended if you are\nnot using Composer to provide autoloading for your module. They provide the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautoload_classmap.php\n\n\nShould return an array classmap of class name/filename pairs (with the filenames resolved via the \n__DIR__\n magic constant).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautoload_function.php\n\n\nShould return a PHP callback that can be passed to \nspl_autoload_register()\n. Typically, this callback should utilize the map returned by \nautoload_classmap.php.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautoload_register.php\n\n\nshould register a PHP callback (is typically returned by \nautoload_function.php\n with \nspl_autoload_register()\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of these three files is to provide reasonable default mechanisms for autoloading the\nclasses contained in the module, thus providing a trivial way to consume the module without\nrequiring zend-modulemanager (e.g., for use outside a ZF2 application).\n\n\nThe \nconfig\n directory should contain any module-specific configuration. These\nfiles may be in any format zend-config supports. We recommend naming the main\nconfiguration \nmodule.config.\nformat\n (e.g., for PHP-based configuration,\n\nmodule.config.php\n). Typically, you will create configuration for the router as\nwell as for the service manager.\n\n\nThe \nsrc\n directory should be a \nPSR-0\n or\n\nPSR-4\n compliant directory structure with\nyour module's source code.\n\n\nThe \ntest\n directory should contain your unit tests. Typically, these are written using\n\nPHPUnit\n.\n\n\nThe \npublic\n directory can be used for assets that you may want to expose in\nyour application's document root. These might include images, CSS files,\nJavaScript files, etc. How these are exposed is left to the developer.\n\n\nThe \nview\n directory contains view scripts related to your controllers.\n\n\nBootstrapping an Application\n\n\nThe \nApplication\n has seven basic dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nconfiguration\n, usually an array or object implementing \nTraversable\n.\n\n\nServiceManager\n instance.\n\n\nEventManager\n instance, which, by default, is pulled from the\n  \nServiceManager\n, by the service name \"EventManager\".\n\n\nSharedEventManager\n instance, which, by default, is pulled from the\n  \nServiceManager\n, by the service name \"SharedEventManager\"; this is injected\n  into the \nEventManager\n instance, and then pushed into every new\n  \nEventManager\n instance created.\n\n\nModuleManager\n instance, which, by default, is pulled from the\n  \nServiceManager\n, by the service name \"ModuleManager\".\n\n\nRequest\n instance, which, by default, is pulled from the \nServiceManager\n,\n  by the service name \"Request\".\n\n\nResponse\n instance, which, by default, is pulled from the \nServiceManager\n,\n  by the service name \"Response\".\n\n\n\n\nThese may be satisfied at instantiation:\n\n\nuse Zend\\EventManager\\EventManager;\nuse Zend\\EventManager\\SharedEventManager;\nuse Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment;\nuse Zend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleManager;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Application;\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager;\n\n$config = include 'config/application.config.php';\n\n$serviceManager = new ServiceManager();\n$serviceManager-\nsetService('SharedEventManager', new SharedEventManager());\n$serviceManager-\nsetService('ModuleManager', new ModuleManager($config));\n$serviceManager-\nsetService('Request', new PhpEnvironment\\Request());\n$serviceManager-\nsetService('Response', new PhpEnvironment\\Response());\n$serviceManager-\nsetFactory('EventManager', function ($serviceManager) {\n    $eventManager = new EventManager();\n    $eventManager-\nsetSharedManager($serviceManager-\nget('SharedEventManager');\n    return $eventManager;\n});\n$serviceManager-\nsetShared('EventManager', false);\n\n$application = new Application($config, $serviceManager);\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've done this, there are two additional actions you can take. The first is to \"bootstrap\"\nthe application. In the default implementation, this does the following:\n\n\n\n\nAttaches the default route listener (\nZend\\Mvc\\RouteListener\n).\n\n\nAttaches the middleware dispatch listener (\nZend\\Mvc\\MiddlewareListener\n)\n  (v2.7.0 and up).\n\n\nAttaches the default dispatch listener (\nZend\\Mvc\\DispatchListener\n).\n\n\nAttaches the \nViewManager\n listener (\nZend\\Mvc\\View\\ViewManager\n).\n\n\nCreates the \nMvcEvent\n, and injects it with the application, request, and\n  response; it also retrieves the router (\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack\n)\n  at this time and attaches it to the event.\n\n\nTriggers the \"bootstrap\" event.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want these actions, or want to provide alternatives, you can do so by extending the\n\nApplication\n class and/or manually coding what actions you want to occur.\n\n\nThe second action you can take with the configured \nApplication\n is to \nrun()\n\nit. Calling this method performs the following:\n\n\n\n\nit triggers the \"route\" event, \n\n\nfollowed by the \"dispatch\" event, and, depending on execution, \n\n\nthe \"render\" event\n\n\n\n\nWhen done, it triggers the \"finish\" event, and then returns the response\ninstance. If an error occurs during either the \"route\" or \"dispatch\" event, a\n\"dispatch.error\" event is triggered as well.\n\n\nThis is a lot to remember in order to bootstrap the application; in fact, we haven't covered all the\nservices available by default yet. You can greatly simplify things by using the default\n\nServiceManager\n configuration shipped with the MVC.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Loader\\AutoloaderFactory;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig;\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager;\n\n// setup autoloader\nAutoloaderFactory::factory();\n\n// get application stack configuration\n$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';\n\n// setup service manager\n$serviceManager = new ServiceManager(new ServiceManagerConfig());\n$serviceManager-\nsetService('ApplicationConfig', $configuration);\n\n// load modules -- which will provide services, configuration, and more\n$serviceManager-\nget('ModuleManager')-\nloadModules();\n\n// bootstrap and run application\n$application = $serviceManager-\nget('Application');\n$application-\nbootstrap();\n$application-\nrun();\n\n\n\n\nYou can make this even simpler by using the \ninit()\n method of the\n\nApplication\n. This is a static method for quick and easy initialization of the\n\nApplication\n instance.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Loader\\AutoloaderFactory;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Application;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig;\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager;\n\n// setup autoloader\nAutoloaderFactory::factory();\n\n// get application stack configuration\n$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';\n\n// The init() method does something very similar with the previous example.\nApplication::init($configuration)-\nrun();\n\n\n\n\nThe \ninit()\n does the following:\n\n\n\n\nGrabs the application configuration and pulls from the \nservice_manager\n key,\n  creating a \nServiceManager\n instance with it and with the default services\n  shipped with zend-mvc;\n\n\nCreates a service named \nApplicationConfig\n with the application configuration array;\n\n\nGrabs the \nModuleManager\n service and loads the modules;\n\n\nbootstrap()\ns the \nApplication\n and returns its instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicationConfig service\n\n\nIf you use the \ninit()\n method, you cannot specify a service with the name of\n'ApplicationConfig' in your service manager config. This name is reserved to\nhold the array from \napplication.config.php\n.  The following services can only\nbe overridden from \napplication.config.php\n:\n\n\n\n\nModuleManager\n\n\nSharedEventManager\n\n\nEventManager\n and \nZend\\EventManager\\EventManagerInterface\n\n\n\n\nAll other services are configured after module loading, thus can be overridden\nby modules.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll note that you have a great amount of control over the workflow. Using the\n\nServiceManager\n, you have fine-grained control over what services are\navailable, how they are instantiated, and what dependencies are injected into\nthem. Using the \nEventManager\n's priority system, you can intercept any of the\napplication events (\"bootstrap\", \"route\", \"dispatch\", \"dispatch.error\",\n\"render\", and \"finish\") anywhere during execution, allowing you to craft your\nown application workflows as needed.\n\n\nBootstrapping a Modular Application\n\n\nWhile the previous approach largely works, where does the configuration come\nfrom? When we create a modular application, the assumption will be that it's\nfrom the modules themselves. How do we get that information and aggregate it,\nthen?\n\n\nThe answer is via zend-modulemanager. This component allows you to specify what\nmodules the application will use; it then locates each module and initializes\nit. Module classes can tie into various listeners in order to provide\nconfiguration, services, listeners, and more to the application. Sounds\ncomplicated? It's not.\n\n\nConfiguring the Module Manager\n\n\nThe first step is configuring the module manager. Inform the module manager\nwhich modules to load, and potentially provide configuration for the module\nlisteners.\n\n\nRemember the \napplication.config.php\n from earlier? We're going to provide some\nconfiguration.\n\n\n?php\n// config/application.config.php\nreturn array(\n    'modules' =\n array(\n        /* ... */\n    ),\n    'module_listener_options' =\n array(\n        'module_paths' =\n array(\n            './module',\n            './vendor',\n        ),\n    ),\n);\n\n\n\n\nAs we add modules to the system, we'll add items to the \nmodules\n array.\n\n\nEach \nModule\n class that has configuration it wants the \nApplication\n to know\nabout should define a \ngetConfig()\n method. That method should return an array\nor \nTraversable\n object such as a \nZend\\Config\\Config\n instance. As an example:\n\n\nnamespace ZendUser;\n\nclass Module\n{\n    public function getConfig()\n    {\n        return include __DIR__ . '/config/module.config.php'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of other methods you can define for tasks ranging from\nproviding autoloader configuration, to providing services to the\n\nServiceManager\n, to listening to the bootstrap event.  The\n\nModuleManager documentation\n\ngoes into more detail on these.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nzend-mvc is incredibly flexible, offering an opt-in, easy to create modular\ninfrastructure, as well as the ability to craft your own application workflows\nvia the \nServiceManager\n and \nEventManager\n. The \nModuleManager\n is a\nlightweight and simple approach to enforcing a modular architecture that\nencourages clean separation of concerns and code re-use.",

The point of these three files is to provide reasonable default mechanisms for autoloading the\nclasses contained in the module, thus providing a trivial way to consume the module without\nrequiring zend-modulemanager (e.g., for use outside a ZF2 application).  The  config  directory should contain any module-specific configuration. These\nfiles may be in any format zend-config supports. We recommend naming the main\nconfiguration  module.config. format  (e.g., for PHP-based configuration, module.config.php ). Typically, you will create configuration for the router as\nwell as for the service manager.  The  src  directory should be a  PSR-0  or PSR-4  compliant directory structure with\nyour module's source code.  The  test  directory should contain your unit tests. Typically, these are written using PHPUnit .  The  public  directory can be used for assets that you may want to expose in\nyour application's document root. These might include images, CSS files,\nJavaScript files, etc. How these are exposed is left to the developer.  The  view  directory contains view scripts related to your controllers.",

The first is to \"bootstrap\"\nthe application. In the default implementation, this does the following:   Attaches the default route listener ( Zend\\Mvc\\RouteListener ).  Attaches the middleware dispatch listener ( Zend\\Mvc\\MiddlewareListener )\n  (v2.7.0 and up).  Attaches the default dispatch listener ( Zend\\Mvc\\DispatchListener ).  Attaches the  ViewManager  listener ( Zend\\Mvc\\View\\ViewManager ).  Creates the  MvcEvent , and injects it with the application, request, and\n  response; it also retrieves the router ( Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack )\n  at this time and attaches it to the event.  Triggers the \"bootstrap\" event.   If you do not want these actions, or want to provide alternatives, you can do so by extending the Application  class and/or manually coding what actions you want to occur.  The second action you can take with the configured  Application  is to  run() \nit. Calling this method performs the following:   it triggers the \"route\" event,   followed by the \"dispatch\" event, and, depending on execution,   the \"render\" event   When done, it triggers the \"finish\" event, and then returns the response\ninstance. If an error occurs during either the \"route\" or \"dispatch\" event, a\n\"dispatch.error\" event is triggered as well.  This is a lot to remember in order to bootstrap the application; in fact, we haven't covered all the\nservices available by default yet. You can greatly simplify things by using the default ServiceManager  configuration shipped with the MVC.  use Zend\\Loader\\AutoloaderFactory;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig;\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager;\n\n// setup autoloader\nAutoloaderFactory::factory();\n\n// get application stack configuration\n$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';\n\n// setup service manager\n$serviceManager = new ServiceManager(new ServiceManagerConfig());\n$serviceManager- setService('ApplicationConfig', $configuration);\n\n// load modules -- which will provide services, configuration, and more\n$serviceManager- get('ModuleManager')- loadModules();\n\n// bootstrap and run application\n$application = $serviceManager- get('Application');\n$application- bootstrap();\n$application- run();  You can make this even simpler by using the  init()  method of the Application . This is a static method for quick and easy initialization of the Application  instance.  use Zend\\Loader\\AutoloaderFactory;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Application;\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig;\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager;\n\n// setup autoloader\nAutoloaderFactory::factory();\n\n// get application stack configuration\n$configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';\n\n// The init() method does something very similar with the previous example.\nApplication::init($configuration)- run();  The  init()  does the following:   Grabs the application configuration and pulls from the  service_manager  key,\n  creating a  ServiceManager  instance with it and with the default services\n  shipped with zend-mvc;  Creates a service named  ApplicationConfig  with the application configuration array;  Grabs the  ModuleManager  service and loads the modules;  bootstrap() s the  Application  and returns its instance.",

It provides a controller to handle the \"home\" page of the\napplication, the layout template, and templates for 404 and error pages.\n\n\nTypically, you will not need to touch this other than to provide an alternate\nentry page for your site and/or alternate error page.\n\n\nAdditional functionality will be provided by creating new modules.\n\n\nTo get you started with modules, we recommend using the \nZendSkeletonModule\n as\na base. Download it from here:\n\n\n\n\nZendSkeletonModule zip package\n\n\nZendSkeletonModule tarball\n\n\n\n\nDeflate the package, and rename the directory \"ZendSkeletonModule\" to reflect\nthe name of the new module you want to create; when done, move the module into\nyour new project's \nmodule/\n directory.\n\n\nAt this point, it's time to create some functionality.\n\n\nUpdate the Module Class\n\n\nLet's update the \nModule\n class. We'll want to make sure the namespace is correct,\nconfiguration is enabled and returned, and that we setup autoloading on\ninitialization. Since we're actively working on this module, the class list will\nbe in flux; we probably want to be pretty lenient in our autoloading approach,\nso let's keep it flexible by using the \nStandardAutoloader\n. Let's begin.\n\n\nFirst, let's have \nautoload_classmap.php\n return an empty array:\n\n\n?php\n// autoload_classmap.php\nreturn array();\n\n\n\n\nWe'll also edit our \nconfig/module.config.php\n file to read as follows:\n\n\nreturn array(\n    'view_manager' =\n array(\n        'template_path_stack' =\n array(\n            '\nmodule-name\n' =\n __DIR__ . '/../view'\n        ),\n    ),\n);\n\n\n\n\nFill in \nmodule-name\n with a lowercased, dash-separated version of your module\nname; e.g., \"ZendUser\" would become \"zend-user\".\n\n\nNext, edit the namespace declaration of the \nModule.php\n file. Replace the\nfollowing line:\n\n\nnamespace ZendSkeletonModule;\n\n\n\n\nwith the namespace you want to use for your application.\n\n\nNext, rename the directory \nsrc/ZendSkeletonModule\n to \nsrc/\nYourModuleName\n,\nand the directory \nview/zend-skeleton-module\n to \nsrc/\nyour-module-name\n.\n\n\nAt this point, you now have your module configured properly. Let's create a\ncontroller!\n\n\nCreate a Controller\n\n\nControllers are objects that implement \nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n. This\nmeans they need to implement a \ndispatch()\n method that takes minimally a\n\nRequest\n object as an argument.\n\n\nIn practice, though, this would mean writing logic to branch based on matched\nrouting within every controller. As such, we've created several base controller\nclasses for you to start with:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController\n allows routes to match an\n  \"action\". When matched, a method named after the action will be called by the\n  controller. As an example, if you had a route that returned \"foo\" for the\n  \"action\" key, the \"fooAction\" method would be invoked.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractRestfulController\n introspects the \nRequest\n to\n  determine what HTTP method was used, and calls a method according to that.\n\n\nGET\n will call either the \ngetList()\n method, or, if an \"id\" was matched\n    during routing, the \nget()\n method (with that identifer value).\n\n\nPOST\n will call the \ncreate()\n method, passing in the \n$_POST\n values.\n\n\nPUT\n expects an \"id\" to be matched during routing, and will call the\n    \nupdate()\n method, passing in the identifier, and any data found in the raw\n    post body.\n\n\nDELETE\n expects an \"id\" to be matched during routing, and will call the\n    \ndelete()\n method.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractConsoleController\n extends from\n  \nAbstractActionController\n, but provides methods for retrieving the\n  \nZend\\Console\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface\n instance, and ensuring that execution\n  fails in non-console environments.\n\n\n\n\nTo get started, we'll create a \"hello world\"-style controller, with a single\naction. First, create the file \nHelloController.php\n in the directory\n\nsrc/\nmodule name\n/Controller\n. Edit it in your favorite text editor or IDE,\nand insert the following contents:\n\n\n?php\nnamespace \nmodule name\n\\Controller;\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController;\nuse Zend\\View\\Model\\ViewModel;\n\nclass HelloController extends AbstractActionController\n{\n    public function worldAction()\n    {\n        $message = $this-\nparams()-\nfromQuery('message', 'foo');\n        return new ViewModel(['message' =\n $message]);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSo, what are we doing here?\n\n\n\n\nWe're creating an action controller.\n\n\nWe're defining an action, \"world\".\n\n\nWe're pulling a message from the query parameters (yes, this is a superbly bad\n  idea in production!  Always sanitize your inputs!).\n\n\nWe're returning a \nViewModel\n with an array of values to be processed later.\n\n\n\n\nWe return a \nViewModel\n. The view layer will use this when rendering the view,\npulling variables and the template name from it. By default, you can omit the\ntemplate name, and it will resolve to \"lowercase-controller-name/lowercase-action-name\".\nHowever, you can override this to specify something different by calling\n\nsetTemplate()\n on the \nViewModel\n instance. Typically, templates will resolve\nto files with a \".phtml\" suffix in your module's \nview\n directory.\n\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's create a view script.\n\n\nCreate a View Script\n\n\nCreate the directory \nview/\nmodule-name\n/hello\n. Inside that directory, create a\nfile named \nworld.phtml\n. Inside that, paste in the following:\n\n\nh1\nGreetings!\n/h1\n\n\n\np\nYou said \n?php echo $this-\nescapeHtml($message) ?\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. Save the file.\n\n\n\n\nEscaping output\n\n\nWhat is the method \nescapeHtml()\n? It's actually a \nview helper\n,\nand it's designed to help mitigate XSS attacks. Never trust user input; if you\nare at all uncertain about the source of a given variable in your view script,\nescape it using one of the provided escape view helpers depending on the type\nof data you have.\n\n\n\n\nView scripts for module names with subnamespaces\n\n\nAs per PSR-0, modules should be named following the rule: \nVendor Name\n\\\nNamespace\n\\*\n.\nHowever, the default controller class to template mapping does not work very\nwell with those: it will remove subnamespace.\n\n\nTo address that issue, new mapping rules were introduced with version 2.3.0. To\nmaintain backwards compatibility, that mapping is not enabled by default. To\nenable it, you need to add your module namespace to a whitelist in your module\nconfiguration:\n\n\n'view_manager' =\n array(\n    // Controller namespace to template map\n    // or whitelisting for controller FQCN to template mapping\n    'controller_map' =\n array(\n        '\nModule\\Name\n' =\n true,\n    ),\n),\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have, you can create the directory \nview/\nmodule\n/\nname\n/hello\n. Inside\nthat directory, create a file named \nworld.phtml\n. Inside that, paste the\nfollowing:\n\n\nh1\nGreetings!\n/h1\n\n\n\np\nYou said \n?php echo $this-\nescapeHtml($message) ?\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Route\n\n\nNow that we have a controller and a view script, we need to create a route to it.\n\n\n\n\nDefault routing\n\n\nZendSkeletonModule\n ships with a \"default route\" that will likely get\nyou to this action. That route is defined roughly as\n\n/{module}/{controller}/{action}\n, which means that the path\n\n/zend-user/hello/world\n will map to \nZendUser\\Controller\\HelloController::worldAction()\n\n(assuming the module name were \nZendUser\n).\n\n\nWe're going to create an explicit route in this example, as\ncreating explicit routes is a recommended practice. The application will look for a\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\RouteStackInterface\n instance to setup routing. The default generated router is a\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack\n.\n\n\nTo use the \"default route\" functionality, you will need to edit the shipped\nrouting definition in the module's \nconfig/module.config.php\n, and replace:\n\n\n\n\n/module-specific-root\n with a module-specific root path.\n\n\nZendSkeletonModule\\Controller\n with \nYourModuleName\n\\Controller\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we need to tell the application we have a controller:\n\n\n// module.config.php\nreturn [\n    'controllers' =\n [\n        'invokables' =\n [\n            '\nmodule-namespace\n\\Controller\\Index' =\n '\nmodule-namespace\n\\Controller\\IndexController',\n            // Do similar for each other controller in your module\n        ],\n    ],\n   // ... other configuration ...\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nController services\n\n\nWe inform the application about controllers we expect to have in the\napplication. This is to prevent somebody requesting any service the\n\nServiceManager\n knows about in an attempt to break the application. The\ndispatcher uses a special, scoped container that will only pull controllers\nthat are specifically registered with it, either as invokable classes or via\nfactories.\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \nconfig/module.config.php\n file, and modify it to add to the \"routes\"\nand \"controller\" parameters so it reads as follows:\n\n\nreturn [\n    'router' =\n [\n        'routes' =\n [\n            '\nmodule name\n-hello-world' =\n [\n                'type'    =\n 'Literal',\n                    'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n '/hello/world',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'controller' =\n '\nmodule name\n\\Controller\\Hello',\n                        'action'     =\n 'world',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n    'controllers' =\n [\n        'invokables' =\n [\n            '\nmodule namespace\n\\Controller\\Hello' =\n '\nmodule\nnamespace\n\\Controller\\HelloController',\n        ],\n    ],\n    // ... other configuration ...\n];\n\n\n\n\nTell the Application About our Module\n\n\nOne problem: we haven't told our application about our new module!\n\n\nBy default, modules are not utilized unless we tell the module manager about them.\nAs such, we need to notify the application about them.\n\n\nRemember the \nconfig/application.config.php\n file? Let's modify it to add our\nnew module. Once done, it should read as follows:\n\n\n?php\nreturn array(\n    'modules' =\n array(\n        'Application',\n        '\nmodule namespace\n',\n    ),\n    'module_listener_options' =\n array(\n        'module_paths' =\n array(\n            './module',\n            './vendor',\n        ),\n    ),\n);\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nmodule namespace\n with the namespace of your module.\n\n\nTest it Out!\n\n\nNow we can test things out! Create a new vhost pointing its document root to the \npublic\n directory\nof your application, and fire it up in a browser. You should see the default homepage template of\nZendSkeletonApplication.\n\n\nNow alter the location in your URL to append the path \"/hello/world\", and load the page. You should\nnow get the following content:\n\n\nh1\nGreetings!\n/h1\n\n\n\np\nYou said \nfoo\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\nNow alter the location to append \"?message=bar\" and load the page. You should now get:\n\n\nh1\nGreetings!\n/h1\n\n\n\np\nYou said \nbar\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You've created your first ZF2 MVC module!",

In practice, though, this would mean writing logic to branch based on matched\nrouting within every controller. As such, we've created several base controller\nclasses for you to start with:   Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController  allows routes to match an\n  \"action\". When matched, a method named after the action will be called by the\n  controller. As an example, if you had a route that returned \"foo\" for the\n  \"action\" key, the \"fooAction\" method would be invoked.  Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractRestfulController  introspects the  Request  to\n  determine what HTTP method was used, and calls a method according to that.  GET  will call either the  getList()  method, or, if an \"id\" was matched\n    during routing, the  get()  method (with that identifer value).  POST  will call the  create()  method, passing in the  $_POST  values.  PUT  expects an \"id\" to be matched during routing, and will call the\n     update()  method, passing in the identifier, and any data found in the raw\n    post body.  DELETE  expects an \"id\" to be matched during routing, and will call the\n     delete()  method.  Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractConsoleController  extends from\n   AbstractActionController , but provides methods for retrieving the\n   Zend\\Console\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface  instance, and ensuring that execution\n  fails in non-console environments.   To get started, we'll create a \"hello world\"-style controller, with a single\naction. First, create the file  HelloController.php  in the directory src/ module name /Controller . Edit it in your favorite text editor or IDE,\nand insert the following contents:  ?php\nnamespace  module name \\Controller;\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController;\nuse Zend\\View\\Model\\ViewModel;\n\nclass HelloController extends AbstractActionController\n{\n    public function worldAction()\n    {\n        $message = $this- params()- fromQuery('message', 'foo');\n        return new ViewModel(['message' =  $message]);\n    }\n}  So, what are we doing here?   We're creating an action controller.  We're defining an action, \"world\".  We're pulling a message from the query parameters (yes, this is a superbly bad\n  idea in production!  Always sanitize your inputs!).  We're returning a  ViewModel  with an array of values to be processed later.   We return a  ViewModel . The view layer will use this when rendering the view,\npulling variables and the template name from it. By default, you can omit the\ntemplate name, and it will resolve to \"lowercase-controller-name/lowercase-action-name\".\nHowever, you can override this to specify something different by calling setTemplate()  on the  ViewModel  instance. Typically, templates will resolve\nto files with a \".phtml\" suffix in your module's  view  directory.  So, with that in mind, let's create a view script.",

            "text": "Default Services\n\n\nThe default and recommended way to write zend-mvc applications uses a set of\nservices defined in the \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\n namespace. This chapter details what\neach of those services are, the classes they represent, and the configuration\noptions available.\n\n\nMany of the services are provided by other components, and the factories and\nabstract factories themselves are defined in the individual components. We will\ncover those factories in this chapter, however, as usage is generally the same\nbetween each.\n\n\nTheory of Operation\n\n\nTo allow easy configuration of all the different parts of the MVC system, a\nsomewhat complex set of services and their factories has been created. We'll try\nto give a simplified explanation of the process.\n\n\nWhen a \nZend\\Mvc\\Application\n is created, a \nZend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager\n\nobject is created and configured via \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig\n.\nThe \nServiceManagerConfig\n gets the configuration from\n\nconfig/application.config.php\n (or some other application configuration you\npassed to the \nApplication\n when creating it). From all the service and\nfactories provided in the \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\n namespace, \nServiceManagerConfig\n\nis responsible of configuring only three: \nSharedEventManager\n, \nEventManager\n,\nand \nModuleManager\n.\n\n\nAfter this, the \nApplication\n fetches the \nModuleManager\n. At this point, the\n\nModuleManager\n further configures the \nServiceManager\n with services and\nfactories provided in \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory\n. This approach\nallows us to keep the main application configuration concise, and to give the\ndeveloper the power to configure different parts of the MVC system from within\nthe modules, overriding any default configuration in these MVC services.\n\n\nServiceManager\n\n\nAs a quick review, the following service types may be configured:\n\n\n\n\nInvokable services\n, which map a service name to a class that has no\n  constructor or a constructor that accepts no arguments.\n\n\nFactories\n, which map a service name to a factory which will create and\n  return an object. A factory receives the service manager as an argument, and\n  may be any PHP callable, or a class or object that implements\n  \nZend\\ServiceManager\\FactoryInterface\n.\n\n\nAbstract factories\n, which are factories that can create any number of\n  named services that share the same instantiation pattern; examples include\n  database adapters, cache adapters, loggers, etc. The factory receives the\n  service manager as an argument, the resolved service name, and the requested\n  service name; it \nmust\n be a class or object implementing\n  \nZend\\ServiceManager\\AbstractFactoryInterface\n. See the section on\n  \nabstract factories\n\n  for configuration information.\n\n\nAliases\n, which alias one service name to another. Aliases can also\n  reference other aliases.\n\n\nInitializers\n, which receive the newly created instance and the service\n  manager, and which can be used to perform additional initialization tasks. The\n  most common use case is to test the instance against specific \"Aware\"\n  interfaces, and, if matching, inject them with the appropriate service.\n\n\nDelegators\n, which typically \ndecorate\n retrieval of a service to either\n  substitute an alternate service, decorate the created service, or perform\n  pre/post initialization tasks when creating a service.\n\n\nLazy services\n, which are decorators for services with expensive\n  initialization; the service manager essentially returns a proxy service that\n  defers initialization until the first call is made to the service.\n\n\nPlugin managers\n, which are specialized service managers used to manage\n  objects that are of a related type, such as view helpers, controller plugins,\n  controllers, etc. Plugin managers accept configuration just like service\n  managers, and as such can compose each of the service types listed above.\n  They are also \nServiceLocatorAware\n, and will be injected with the application\n  service manager instance, giving factories and abstract factories access to\n  application-level services when needed. See the heading\n  \nPlugin managers\n for a list of available plugin managers.\n\n\n\n\nThe application service manager is referenced directly during bootstrapping, and has the following\nservices configured out of the box.\n\n\nInvokable services\n\n\n\n\nDispatchListener\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\DispatchListener\n.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\MiddlewareListener\n.\n\n\nRouteListener\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\RouteListener\n.\n\n\nSendResponseListener\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\SendResponseListener\n.\n\n\nSharedEventManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\EventManager\\SharedEventManager\n.\n\n\n\n\nFactories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ApplicationFactory\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfig\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConfigFactory\n. Internally, this\n  pulls the \nModuleManager\n service, calls its \nloadModules()\n method, and\n  retrieves the merged configuration from the module event. As such, this\n  service contains the entire, merged application configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllerManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ControllerLoaderFactory\n.\n  This creates an instance of \nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\ControllerManager\n, passing\n  the service manager instance.  Additionally, it uses the\n  \nDiStrictAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively allowing you to fall\n  back to DI in order to retrieve your controllers. If you want to use\n  \nZend\\Di\n to retrieve your controllers, you must white-list them in your DI\n  configuration under the \nallowed_controllers\n key (otherwise, they will just\n  be ignored).  The \nControllerManager\n provides initializers for the\n  following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the controller implements \nZend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface\n\n  (or the methods it defines), an instance of the \nServiceManager\n will be\n  injected into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the controller implements \nZend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface\n,\n  an instance of the \nEventManager\n will be injected into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, an initializer will inject it with the \nControllerPluginManager\n\n  service, as long as the \nsetPluginManager\n method is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllerPluginManager\n, mapping to\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ControllerPluginManagerFactory\n. This instantiates the\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\PluginManager\n instance, passing it the service manager\n  instance. It also uses the \nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively\n  allowing you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve your \ncontroller plugins\n.\n  It registers a set of default controller plugins, and contains an\n  initializer for injecting plugins with the current controller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsoleAdapter\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleAdapterFactory\n. This\n  grabs the \nConfig\n service, pulls from the \nconsole\n key, and do the\n  following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nadapter\n subkey is present, it is used to get the adapter\n  instance, otherwise, \nZend\\Console\\Console::detectBestAdapter()\n will be\n  called to configure an adapter instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \ncharset\n subkey is present, the value is used to set the adapter\n  charset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsoleRouter\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleRouterFactory\n. This\n  grabs the \nConfig\n service, and pulls from the \nconsole\n key and \nrouter\n\n  subkey, configuring a \nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Console\\SimpleRouteStack\n instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsoleViewManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleViewManagerFactory\n.\n  This creates and returns an instance of \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\Console\\ViewManager\n,\n  which in turn registers and initializes a number of console-specific view\n  services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencyInjector\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiFactory\n. This pulls\n  the \nConfig\n service, and looks for a \"di\" key; if found, that value is used\n  to configure a new \nZend\\Di\\Di\n instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n, mapping to\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiAbstractServiceFactoryFactory\n. This creates an instance\n  of \nZend\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiAbstractServiceFactory\n injecting the \nDi\n\n  service instance. That instance is attached to the service manager as an\n  abstract factory, effectively enabling DI as a fallback for providing\n  services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiServiceInitializer\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiServiceInitializerFactory\n.\n  This creates an instance of \nZend\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiServiceInitializer\n\n  injecting the \nDi\n service and the service manager itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiStrictAbstractServiceFactory\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory\n.\n  This creates an instance of \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory\n,\n  injecting the \nDi\n service instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEventManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\EventManagerFactory\n. This\n  factory returns a \ndiscrete\n instance of \nZend\\EventManager\\EventManager\n on\n  each request. This service is not shared by default, allowing the ability to\n  have an \nEventManager\n per service, with a shared \nSharedEventManager\n\n  injected in each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilterManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\FilterManagerFactory\n. This\n  instantiates the \nZend\\Filter\\FilterPluginManager\n instance, passing it the\n  service manager instance; this is used to manage filters for \nfilter chains\n.\n  It also uses the \nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormElementManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\FormElementManagerFactory\n.\n  This instantiates the \nZend\\Form\\FormElementManager\n instance, passing it\n  the service manager instance; this is used to manage \nform elements\n.\n  It also uses the \nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve form elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHttpRouter\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\HttpRouterFactory\n. This grabs\n  the \nConfig\n service, and pulls from the \nrouter\n key, configuring a\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack\n instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHttpViewManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\HttpViewManagerFactory\n.\n  This creates and returns an instance of \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\Http\\ViewManager\n,\n  which in turn registers and initializes a number of HTTP-specific view\n  services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydratorManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\HydratorManagerFactory\n.\n  This creates and returns an instance of \nZend\\Stdlib\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManager\n,\n  which can be used to manage and persist hydrator instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputFilterManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\InputFilterManagerFactory\n.\n  This creates and returns an instance of \nZend\\InputFilter\\InputFilterPluginManager\n,\n  which can be used to manage and persist input filter instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModuleManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ModuleManagerFactory\n. This is\n  perhaps the most complex factory in the MVC stack. It expects that an\n  \nApplicationConfig\n service has been injected, with keys for\n  \nmodule_listener_options\n and \nmodules\n; see the quick start for samples.\n  It creates an instance of \nZend\\ModuleManager\\Listener\\DefaultListenerAggregate\n,\n  using the \nmodule_listener_options\n retrieved. It then checks if a service\n  with the name \nServiceListener\n exists; if not, it sets a factory with that\n  name mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory\n. A bunch of\n  service listeners will be added to the \nServiceListener\n, like listeners for\n  the \ngetServiceConfig\n, \ngetControllerConfig\n, \ngetControllerPluginConfig\n,\n  and \ngetViewHelperConfig\n module methods.  Next, it retrieves the\n  \nEventManager\n service, and attaches the above listeners.  It instantiates a\n  \nZend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleEvent\n instance, setting the \"ServiceManager\"\n  parameter to the service manager object.  Finally, it instantiates a\n  \nZend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleManager\n instance, and injects the \nEventManager\n\n  and \nModuleEvent\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMvcTranslator\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\TranslatorServiceFactory\n, and\n  returning an instance of \nZend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator\n, which extends\n  \nZend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator\n and implements \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n,\n  allowing the instance to be used anywhere a translator may be required in\n  the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaginatorPluginManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\PaginatorPluginManagerFactory\n.\n  This instantiates the \nZend\\Paginator\\AdapterPluginManager\n instance,\n  passing it the service manager instance. This is used to manage\n  \npaginator adapters\n.\n  It also uses the \nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve paginator adapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\RequestFactory\n. The factory is used\n  to create and return a request instance, according to the current\n  environment. If the current environment is a console environment, it will\n  create a \nZend\\Console\\Request\n; otherwise, for HTTP environments, it\n  creates a \nZend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Request\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ResponseFactory\n. The factory is\n  used to create and return a response instance, according to the current\n  environment. If the current environment is a console environment, it will\n  create a \nZend\\Console\\Response\n; otherwise, for HTTP environments, it\n  creates a \nZend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouter\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory\n. If in a console\n  enviroment, it proxies to the \nConsoleRouter\n service; otherwise, it proxies\n  to the \nHttpRouter\n service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutePluginManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\RoutePluginManagerFactory\n.\n  This instantiates the \nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\RoutePluginManager\n instance, passing\n  it the service manager instance; this is used to manage \nroute types\n.\n  It also uses the \nDiAbstractServiceFactory\n service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve route types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerializerAdapterManager\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\SerializerAdapterPluginManagerFactory\n,\n  which returns an instance of \nZend\\Serializer\\AdapterPluginManager\n. This is\n  a plugin manager for managing serializer adapter instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServiceListener\n, mapping to \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory\n. The\n  factory is used to instantiate the \nServiceListener\n, while allowing easy\n  extending. It checks if a service with the name \nServiceListenerInterface\n\n  exists, which must implement \nZend\\ModuleManager\\Listener\\ServiceListenerInterface\n,\n  before instantiating the default \nServiceListener\n.\n  In addition to this, it retrieves the \nApplicationConfig\n and looks for the\n  \nservice_listener_options\n key.

Each is noted below, along with sample\nconfiguration.\n\n\nIn each instance, the abstract factory looks for a top-level configuration key,\nconsisting of key/value pairs where the key is the service name, and the value\nis the configuration to use to create the given service.\n\n\nZend\\Cache\\Service\\StorageCacheAbstractServiceFactory\n\n\nThis abstract factory is opt-in, but registered by default in the skeleton application. It uses the\ntop-level configuration key \"caches\".\n\n\nreturn [\n    'caches' =\n [\n        'Cache\\Transient' =\n [\n            'adapter' =\n 'redis',\n            'ttl'     =\n 60,\n            'plugins' =\n [\n                'exception_handler' =\n [\n                    'throw_exceptions' =\n false,\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n        'Cache\\Persistence' =\n [\n            'adapter' =\n 'filesystem',\n            'ttl'     =\n 86400,\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n\n\n\nSee the \ncache documentation\n\nfor more configuration options.\n\n\nZend\\Db\\Adapter\\AdapterAbstractServiceFactory\n\n\nThis abstract factory is opt-in.

It uses the top-level\nconfiguration key \"forms\". It makes use of the \nFilterManager\n,\n\nFormElementManager\n, \nHydratorManager\n, \nInputFilterManager\n, and\n\nValidatorManager\n plugin managers in order to allow instantiation and creation\nof form objects and all related objects in the form hierarchy.\n\n\nreturn [\n    'forms' =\n [\n        'Form\\Foo' =\n [\n            'hydrator' =\n 'ObjectProperty',\n            'type'     =\n 'Zend\\Form\\Form',\n            'elements' =\n [\n                [\n                    'spec' =\n [\n                        'type' =\n 'Zend\\Form\\Element\\Email',\n                        'name' =\n 'email',\n                        'options' =\n [\n                            'label' =\n 'Your email address',\n                        ],\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n\n\n\nForm configuration follows the same configuration you would use with a form\nfactory; the primary difference is that all plugin managers have already been\ninjected for you, allowing you the possibility of custom objects or\nsubstitutions.\n\n\nSee the \nform factory documentation\n\nfor more configuration options.\n\n\nZend\\Log\\LoggerAbstractServiceFactory\n\n\nThis abstract factory is opt-in, but registered by default in the skeleton\napplication.

As such, \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\ViewManager\n was created to handle\ncreation of the various objects, as well as wiring them together and\nestablishing event listeners.\n\n\nThe \nViewManager\n itself is an event listener on the \nbootstrap\n event. It\nretrieves the \nServiceManager\n from the \nApplication\n object, as well as its\ncomposed \nEventManager\n.\n\n\nConfiguration for all members of the \nViewManager\n fall under the \nview_manager\n\nconfiguration key, and expect values as noted below. The following services are\ncreated and managed by the \nViewManager\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewHelperManager\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\View\\HelperPluginManager\n.\n  It is seeded with the \nServiceManager\n. Created via the\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Service\\ViewHelperManagerFactory\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRouter\n service is retrieved, and injected into the \nUrl\n helper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nbase_path\n key is present, it is used to inject the \nBasePath\n view\n  helper; otherwise, the \nRequest\n service is retrieved, and the value of its\n  \ngetBasePath()\n method is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \nbase_path_console\n key is present, it is used to inject the\n  \nBasePath\n view helper for console requests; otherwise, the \nRequest\n\n  service is retrieved, and the value of its \ngetBasePath()\n method is used.\n  This can be useful for sending urls in emails via a cronjob.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the \ndoctype\n key is present, it will be used to set the value of the\n  \nDoctype\n view helper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewTemplateMapResolver\n, representing and aliased to\n  \nZend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplateMapResolver\n.  If a \ntemplate_map\n key is present,\n  it will be used to seed the template map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewTemplatePathStack\n, representing and aliased to\n  \nZend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a \ntemplate_path_stack\n key is present, it will be used to seed the\n  stack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a \ndefault_template_suffix\n key is present, it will be used as the\n  default suffix for template scripts resolving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewResolver\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\View\\Resolver\\AggregateResolver\n\n  and \nZend\\View\\Resolver\\ResolverInterface\n. It is seeded with the\n  \nViewTemplateMapResolver\n and \nViewTemplatePathStack\n services as resolvers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewRenderer\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer\n\n  and \nZend\\View\\Renderer\\RendererInterface\n. It is seeded with the\n  \nViewResolver\n and \nViewHelperManager\n services. Additionally, the \nViewModel\n\n  helper gets seeded with the \nViewModel\n as its root (layout) model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewPhpRendererStrategy\n, representing and aliased to\n  \nZend\\View\\Strategy\\PhpRendererStrategy\n. It gets seeded with the\n  \nViewRenderer\n service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\View\\View\n. It gets seeded with the\n  \nEventManager\n service, and attaches the \nViewPhpRendererStrategy\n as an\n  aggregate listener.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaultRenderingStrategy\n, representing and aliased to\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\DefaultRenderingStrategy\n.  If the \nlayout\n key is present, it\n  is used to seed the strategy's layout template. It is seeded with the \nView\n\n  service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptionStrategy\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\ExceptionStrategy\n.\n  If the \ndisplay_exceptions\n or \nexception_template\n keys are present, they are\n  used to configure the strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouteNotFoundStrategy\n, representing and aliased to \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\RouteNotFoundStrategy\n\n  and \n404Strategy\n. If the \ndisplay_not_found_reason\n or \nnot_found_template\n\n  keys are present, they are used to configure the strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewModel\n. In this case, no service is registered; the \nViewModel\n is\n  retrieved from the \nMvcEvent\n and injected with the layout template name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nViewManager\n also creates several other listeners, but does not expose them\nas services; these include \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\CreateViewModelListener\n,\n\nZend\\Mvc\\View\\InjectTemplateListener\n, and \nZend\\Mvc\\View\\InjectViewModelListener\n.\nThese, along with \nRouteNotFoundStrategy\n, \nExceptionStrategy\n, and\n\nDefaultRenderingStrategy\n are attached as listeners either to the application\n\nEventManager\n instance or the \nSharedEventManager\n instance.\n\n\nFinally, if you have a \nstrategies\n key in your configuration, the \nViewManager\n\nwill loop over these and attach them in order to the \nView\n service as\nlisteners, at a priority of 100 (allowing them to execute before the\n\nDefaultRenderingStrategy\n).\n\n\nApplication Configuration Options\n\n\nThe following options may be used to provide initial configuration for the\n\nServiceManager\n, \nModuleManager\n, and \nApplication\n instances, allowing them to\nthen find and aggregate the configuration used for the \nConfig\n service, which\nis intended for configuring all other objects in the system.

When a  Zend\\Mvc\\Application  is created, a  Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager \nobject is created and configured via  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfig .\nThe  ServiceManagerConfig  gets the configuration from config/application.config.php  (or some other application configuration you\npassed to the  Application  when creating it). From all the service and\nfactories provided in the  Zend\\Mvc\\Service  namespace,  ServiceManagerConfig \nis responsible of configuring only three:  SharedEventManager ,  EventManager ,\nand  ModuleManager .  After this, the  Application  fetches the  ModuleManager . At this point, the ModuleManager  further configures the  ServiceManager  with services and\nfactories provided in  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory . This approach\nallows us to keep the main application configuration concise, and to give the\ndeveloper the power to configure different parts of the MVC system from within\nthe modules, overriding any default configuration in these MVC services.",

            "text": "As a quick review, the following service types may be configured:   Invokable services , which map a service name to a class that has no\n  constructor or a constructor that accepts no arguments.  Factories , which map a service name to a factory which will create and\n  return an object. A factory receives the service manager as an argument, and\n  may be any PHP callable, or a class or object that implements\n   Zend\\ServiceManager\\FactoryInterface .  Abstract factories , which are factories that can create any number of\n  named services that share the same instantiation pattern; examples include\n  database adapters, cache adapters, loggers, etc. The factory receives the\n  service manager as an argument, the resolved service name, and the requested\n  service name; it  must  be a class or object implementing\n   Zend\\ServiceManager\\AbstractFactoryInterface . See the section on\n   abstract factories \n  for configuration information.  Aliases , which alias one service name to another. Aliases can also\n  reference other aliases.  Initializers , which receive the newly created instance and the service\n  manager, and which can be used to perform additional initialization tasks. The\n  most common use case is to test the instance against specific \"Aware\"\n  interfaces, and, if matching, inject them with the appropriate service.  Delegators , which typically  decorate  retrieval of a service to either\n  substitute an alternate service, decorate the created service, or perform\n  pre/post initialization tasks when creating a service.  Lazy services , which are decorators for services with expensive\n  initialization; the service manager essentially returns a proxy service that\n  defers initialization until the first call is made to the service.  Plugin managers , which are specialized service managers used to manage\n  objects that are of a related type, such as view helpers, controller plugins,\n  controllers, etc. Plugin managers accept configuration just like service\n  managers, and as such can compose each of the service types listed above.\n  They are also  ServiceLocatorAware , and will be injected with the application\n  service manager instance, giving factories and abstract factories access to\n  application-level services when needed. See the heading\n   Plugin managers  for a list of available plugin managers.   The application service manager is referenced directly during bootstrapping, and has the following\nservices configured out of the box.",

Internally, this\n  pulls the  ModuleManager  service, calls its  loadModules()  method, and\n  retrieves the merged configuration from the module event. As such, this\n  service contains the entire, merged application configuration.    ControllerManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ControllerLoaderFactory .\n  This creates an instance of  Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\ControllerManager , passing\n  the service manager instance.  Additionally, it uses the\n   DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively allowing you to fall\n  back to DI in order to retrieve your controllers. If you want to use\n   Zend\\Di  to retrieve your controllers, you must white-list them in your DI\n  configuration under the  allowed_controllers  key (otherwise, they will just\n  be ignored).  The  ControllerManager  provides initializers for the\n  following:    If the controller implements  Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface \n  (or the methods it defines), an instance of the  ServiceManager  will be\n  injected into it.    If the controller implements  Zend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface ,\n  an instance of the  EventManager  will be injected into it.    Finally, an initializer will inject it with the  ControllerPluginManager \n  service, as long as the  setPluginManager  method is implemented.      ControllerPluginManager , mapping to\n   Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ControllerPluginManagerFactory . This instantiates the\n   Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\PluginManager  instance, passing it the service manager\n  instance. It also uses the  DiAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively\n  allowing you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve your  controller plugins .\n  It registers a set of default controller plugins, and contains an\n  initializer for injecting plugins with the current controller.    ConsoleAdapter , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleAdapterFactory . This\n  grabs the  Config  service, pulls from the  console  key, and do the\n  following:    If the  adapter  subkey is present, it is used to get the adapter\n  instance, otherwise,  Zend\\Console\\Console::detectBestAdapter()  will be\n  called to configure an adapter instance.    If the  charset  subkey is present, the value is used to set the adapter\n  charset.      ConsoleRouter , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleRouterFactory . This\n  grabs the  Config  service, and pulls from the  console  key and  router \n  subkey, configuring a  Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Console\\SimpleRouteStack  instance.    ConsoleViewManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ConsoleViewManagerFactory .\n  This creates and returns an instance of  Zend\\Mvc\\View\\Console\\ViewManager ,\n  which in turn registers and initializes a number of console-specific view\n  services.    DependencyInjector , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiFactory . This pulls\n  the  Config  service, and looks for a \"di\" key; if found, that value is used\n  to configure a new  Zend\\Di\\Di  instance.    DiAbstractServiceFactory , mapping to\n   Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiAbstractServiceFactoryFactory . This creates an instance\n  of  Zend\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiAbstractServiceFactory  injecting the  Di \n  service instance. That instance is attached to the service manager as an\n  abstract factory, effectively enabling DI as a fallback for providing\n  services.    DiServiceInitializer , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiServiceInitializerFactory .\n  This creates an instance of  Zend\\ServiceManager\\Di\\DiServiceInitializer \n  injecting the  Di  service and the service manager itself.    DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory .\n  This creates an instance of  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory ,\n  injecting the  Di  service instance.    EventManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\EventManagerFactory . This\n  factory returns a  discrete  instance of  Zend\\EventManager\\EventManager  on\n  each request. This service is not shared by default, allowing the ability to\n  have an  EventManager  per service, with a shared  SharedEventManager \n  injected in each.    FilterManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\FilterManagerFactory . This\n  instantiates the  Zend\\Filter\\FilterPluginManager  instance, passing it the\n  service manager instance; this is used to manage filters for  filter chains .\n  It also uses the  DiAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve filters.    FormElementManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\FormElementManagerFactory .\n  This instantiates the  Zend\\Form\\FormElementManager  instance, passing it\n  the service manager instance; this is used to manage  form elements .\n  It also uses the  DiAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve form elements.

HydratorManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\HydratorManagerFactory .\n  This creates and returns an instance of  Zend\\Stdlib\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManager ,\n  which can be used to manage and persist hydrator instances.    InputFilterManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\InputFilterManagerFactory .\n  This creates and returns an instance of  Zend\\InputFilter\\InputFilterPluginManager ,\n  which can be used to manage and persist input filter instances.    ModuleManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ModuleManagerFactory . This is\n  perhaps the most complex factory in the MVC stack. It expects that an\n   ApplicationConfig  service has been injected, with keys for\n   module_listener_options  and  modules ; see the quick start for samples.\n  It creates an instance of  Zend\\ModuleManager\\Listener\\DefaultListenerAggregate ,\n  using the  module_listener_options  retrieved. It then checks if a service\n  with the name  ServiceListener  exists; if not, it sets a factory with that\n  name mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory . A bunch of\n  service listeners will be added to the  ServiceListener , like listeners for\n  the  getServiceConfig ,  getControllerConfig ,  getControllerPluginConfig ,\n  and  getViewHelperConfig  module methods.  Next, it retrieves the\n   EventManager  service, and attaches the above listeners.  It instantiates a\n   Zend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleEvent  instance, setting the \"ServiceManager\"\n  parameter to the service manager object.  Finally, it instantiates a\n   Zend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleManager  instance, and injects the  EventManager \n  and  ModuleEvent .    MvcTranslator , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\TranslatorServiceFactory , and\n  returning an instance of  Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator , which extends\n   Zend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator  and implements  Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface ,\n  allowing the instance to be used anywhere a translator may be required in\n  the framework.    PaginatorPluginManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\PaginatorPluginManagerFactory .\n  This instantiates the  Zend\\Paginator\\AdapterPluginManager  instance,\n  passing it the service manager instance. This is used to manage\n   paginator adapters .\n  It also uses the  DiAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve paginator adapters.    Request , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RequestFactory . The factory is used\n  to create and return a request instance, according to the current\n  environment. If the current environment is a console environment, it will\n  create a  Zend\\Console\\Request ; otherwise, for HTTP environments, it\n  creates a  Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Request .    Response , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ResponseFactory . The factory is\n  used to create and return a response instance, according to the current\n  environment. If the current environment is a console environment, it will\n  create a  Zend\\Console\\Response ; otherwise, for HTTP environments, it\n  creates a  Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response .    Router , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory . If in a console\n  enviroment, it proxies to the  ConsoleRouter  service; otherwise, it proxies\n  to the  HttpRouter  service.    RoutePluginManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RoutePluginManagerFactory .\n  This instantiates the  Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\RoutePluginManager  instance, passing\n  it the service manager instance; this is used to manage  route types .\n  It also uses the  DiAbstractServiceFactory  service, effectively allowing\n  you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve route types.    SerializerAdapterManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\SerializerAdapterPluginManagerFactory ,\n  which returns an instance of  Zend\\Serializer\\AdapterPluginManager . This is\n  a plugin manager for managing serializer adapter instances.    ServiceListener , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceListenerFactory . The\n  factory is used to instantiate the  ServiceListener , while allowing easy\n  extending. It checks if a service with the name  ServiceListenerInterface \n  exists, which must implement  Zend\\ModuleManager\\Listener\\ServiceListenerInterface ,\n  before instantiating the default  ServiceListener .\n  In addition to this, it retrieves the  ApplicationConfig  and looks for the\n   service_listener_options  key. This allows you to register own listeners\n  for module methods and configuration keys to create an own service manager;\n  see the  application configuration options  for samples.    ValidatorManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ValidatorManagerFactory .\n  This instantiates the  Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorPluginManager  instance,\n  passing it the service manager instance.

ViewManager , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ViewManagerFactory . The factory\n  is used to create and return a view manager, according to the current\n  environment. If the current environment is a console environment, it will\n  create a  Zend\\Mvc\\View\\Console\\ViewManager ; otherwise, for HTTP\n  environments, it returns a  Zend\\Mvc\\View\\Http\\ViewManager .    ViewResolver , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ViewResolverFactory , which\n  creates and returns the aggregate view resolver. It also attaches the\n   ViewTemplateMapResolver  and  ViewTemplatePathStack  services to it.    ViewTemplateMapResolver , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ViewTemplateMapResolverFactory ,\n  which creates, configures and returns the  Zend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplateMapResolver .    ViewTemplatePathStack , mapping to  Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ViewTemplatePathStackFactory ,\n  which creates, configures and returns the  Zend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack .",

            "location": "/routing/",
            "text": "Routing\n\n\nRouting is the act of matching a request to a given controller.\n\n\nTypically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt to match the URI\npath segment against provided constraints. If the constraints match, a set of\n\"matches\" are returned, one of which should be the controller name to execute.\nRouting can utilize other portions of the request URI or environment as well.\nFor example, the host or scheme, query parameters, headers, request method, and\nmore.\n\n\nThe base unit of routing is a \nRoute\n:\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Mvc\\Router;\n\nuse Zend\\Stdlib\\RequestInterface as Request;\n\ninterface RouteInterface\n{\n    public static function factory(array $options = []);\n    public function match(Request $request);\n    public function assemble(array $params = [], array $options = []);\n}\n\n\n\n\nA \nRoute\n accepts a \nRequest\n, and determines if it matches. If so, it returns a\n\nRouteMatch\n object:\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Mvc\\Router;\n\nclass RouteMatch\n{\n    public function __construct(array $params);\n    public function setMatchedRouteName($name);\n    public function getMatchedRouteName();\n    public function setParam($name, $value);\n    public function getParams();\n    public function getParam($name, $default = null);\n}\n\n\n\n\nTypically, when a \nRoute\n matches, it will define one or more parameters. These\nare passed into the \nRouteMatch\n, and objects may query the \nRouteMatch\n for\ntheir values.\n\n\n$id = $routeMatch-\ngetParam('id', false);\nif (! $id) {\n    throw new Exception('Required identifier is missing!');\n}\n$entity = $resource-\nget($id);\n\n\n\n\nUsually you will have multiple routes you wish to test against. In order to\nfacilitate this, you will use a route aggregate, usually implementing\n\nRouteStack\n:\n\n\nnamespace Zend\\Mvc\\Router;\n\ninterface RouteStackInterface extends RouteInterface\n{\n    public function addRoute($name, $route, $priority = null);\n    public function addRoutes(array $routes);\n    public function removeRoute($name);\n    public function setRoutes(array $routes);\n}\n\n\n\n\nRoutes will be queried in a LIFO order, and hence the reason behind the name\n\nRouteStack\n. zend-mvc provides two implementations of this interface,\n\nSimpleRouteStack\n and \nTreeRouteStack\n. In each, you register routes either one\nat a time using \naddRoute()\n, or in bulk using \naddRoutes()\n.\n\n\n// One at a time:\n$route = Literal::factory([\n    'route' =\n '/foo',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n 'foo-index',\n        'action'     =\n 'index',\n    ],\n]);\n$router-\naddRoute('foo', $route);\n\n// In bulk:\n$router-\naddRoutes([\n    // using already instantiated routes:\n    'foo' =\n $route,\n\n    // providing configuration to allow lazy-loading routes:\n    'bar' =\n [\n        'type' =\n 'literal',\n        'options' =\n [\n            'route' =\n '/bar',\n            'defaults' =\n [\n                'controller' =\n 'bar-index',\n                'action'     =\n 'index',\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nRouter Types\n\n\nTwo routers are provided, the \nSimpleRouteStack\n and \nTreeRouteStack\n. Each\nworks with the above interface, but utilize slightly different options and\nexecution paths. By default, the zend-mvc uses the \nTreeRouteStack\n as the\nrouter.\n\n\nSimpleRouteStack\n\n\nThis router takes individual routes that provide their full matching logic in\none go, and loops through them in LIFO order until a match is found. As such,\nroutes that will match most often should be registered last, and least common\nroutes first. Additionally, you will need to ensure that routes that potentially\noverlap are registered such that the most specific match will match first (i.e.,\nregister later). Alternatively, you can set priorities by giving the priority as\nthird parameter to the \naddRoute()\n method, specifying the priority in the route\nspecifications or setting the priority property within a route instance before\nadding it to the route stack.\n\n\nTreeRouteStack\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack\n provides the ability to register trees of\nroutes, and uses a B-tree algorithm to match routes. As such, you register a\nsingle route with many children.\n\n\nA \nTreeRouteStack\n will consist of the following configuration:\n\n\n\n\nA base \"route\", which describes the base match needed, the root of the tree.\n\n\nAn optional \nroute_plugins\n, which is a configured\n  \nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\RoutePluginManager\n that can lazy-load routes.\n\n\nThe option \nmay_terminate\n, which hints to the router that no other segments\n  will follow it.\n\n\nAn optional \nchild_routes\n array, which contains additional routes that stem\n  from the base \"route\" (i.e., build from it). Each child route can itself be a\n  \nTreeRouteStack\n if desired; in fact, the \nPart\n route works exactly this way.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a route matches against a \nTreeRouteStack\n, the matched parameters from\neach segment of the tree will be returned.\n\n\nA \nTreeRouteStack\n can be your sole route for your application, or describe\nparticular path segments of the application.\n\n\nAn example of a \nTreeRouteStack\n is provided in the documentation of the \nPart\n\nroute.\n\n\nHTTP Route Types\n\n\nzend-mvc ships with the following HTTP route types.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Hostname\n\n\nThe \nHostname\n route attempts to match the hostname registered in the request\nagainst specific criteria. Typically, this will be in one of the following\nforms:\n\n\n\n\nsubdomain.domain.tld\n\n\n:subdomain.domain.tld\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, the second route would return a \"subdomain\" key as part of the\nroute match.\n\n\nFor any given hostname segment, you may also provide a constraint. As an\nexample, if the \"subdomain\" segment needed to match only if it started with \"fw\"\nand contained exactly 2 digits following, the following route would be needed:\n\n\n$route = Hostname::factory([\n    'route' =\n ':subdomain.domain.tld',\n    'constraints' =\n [\n        'subdomain' =\n 'fw\\d{2}',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, only a \"subdomain\" key will be returned in the\n\nRouteMatch\n. If you wanted to also provide other information based on matching,\nor a default value to return for the subdomain, you need to also provide\ndefaults.\n\n\n$route = Hostname::factory([\n    'route' =\n ':subdomain.domain.tld',\n    'constraints' =\n [\n        'subdomain' =\n 'fw\\d{2}',\n    ],\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'type' =\n 'json',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nWhen matched, the above will return two keys in the \nRouteMatch\n, \"subdomain\"\nand \"type\".\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal\n\n\nThe \nLiteral\n route is for doing exact matching of the URI path. Configuration\ntherefore is solely the path you want to match, and the \"defaults\", or\nparameters you want returned on a match.\n\n\n$route = Literal::factory([\n    'route' =\n '/foo',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n        'action' =\n 'foo',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThe above route would match a path \"/foo\", and return the key \"action\" in the\n\nRouteMatch\n, with the value \"foo\".\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Method\n\n\nThe \nMethod\n route is used to match the HTTP method or 'verb' specified in the\nrequest (See RFC 2616 Sec. 5.1.1). It can optionally be configured to match\nagainst multiple methods by providing a comma-separated list of method tokens.\n\n\n$route = Method::factory([\n    'verb' =\n 'post,put',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n        'action' =\n 'form-submit',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThe above route would match an http \"POST\" or \"PUT\" request and return a\n\nRouteMatch\n object containing a key \"action\" with a value of \"form-submit\".\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Part\n\n\nA \nPart\n route allows crafting a tree of possible routes based on segments of\nthe URI path. It actually extends the \nTreeRouteStack\n.\n\n\nPart\n routes are difficult to describe, so we'll simply provide a sample one\nhere.\n\n\n$route = Part::factory([\n    'route' =\n [\n        'type' =\n 'literal',\n        'options' =\n [\n            'route' =\n '/',\n            'defaults' =\n [\n                'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n                'action' =\n 'index',\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n    'route_plugins' =\n $routePlugins,\n    'may_terminate' =\n true,\n    'child_routes' =\n [\n        'blog' =\n [\n            'type' =\n 'literal',\n            'options' =\n [\n                'route' =\n '/blog',\n                'defaults' =\n [\n                    'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController',\n                    'action' =\n 'index',\n                ],\n            ],\n            'may_terminate' =\n true,\n            'child_routes' =\n [\n                'rss' =\n [\n                    'type' =\n 'literal',\n                    'options' =\n [\n                        'route' =\n '/rss',\n                        'defaults' =\n [\n                            'action' =\n 'rss',\n                        ]\n                    ],\n                    'may_terminate' =\n true,\n                    'child_routes' =\n [\n                        'subrss' =\n [\n                            'type' =\n 'literal',\n                            'options' =\n [\n                                'route' =\n '/sub',\n                                'defaults' =\n [\n                                    'action' =\n 'subrss',\n                                ],\n                            ],\n                        ],\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n        'forum' =\n [\n            'type' =\n 'literal',\n            'options' =\n [\n                'route' =\n 'forum',\n                'defaults' =\n [\n                    'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\ForumController',\n                    'action' =\n 'index',\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThe above would match the following:\n\n\n\n\n/\n would load the \"Index\" controller, \"index\" action.\n\n\n/blog\n would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"index\" action.\n\n\n/blog/rss\n would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"rss\" action.\n\n\n/blog/rss/sub\n would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"subrss\" action.\n\n\n/forum\n would load the \"Forum\" controller, \"index\" action.\n\n\n\n\nYou may use any route type as a child route of a \nPart\n route.\n\n\n\n\nPart routes are an implementation detail\n\n\nPart\n routes are not meant to be used directly. When you add definitions for\n\nchild_routes\n to any route type, that route will become a \nPart\n route. As\nalready said, describing \nPart\n routes with words is difficult, so hopefully\nthe additional \nexamples at the end\n will provide\nfurther insight.\n\n\nRoute plugins\n\n\nIn the above example, the \n$routePlugins\n is an instance of\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\RoutePluginManager\n, containing essentially the following\nconfiguration:\n\n\n$routePlugins = new Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\RoutePluginManager();\n$plugins = [\n    'hostname' =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Hostname',\n    'literal'  =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal',\n    'part'     =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Part',\n    'regex'    =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Regex',\n    'scheme'   =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Scheme',\n    'segment'  =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Segment',\n    'wildcard' =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Wildcard',\n    'query'    =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Query',\n    'method'   =\n 'Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Method',\n];\nforeach ($plugins as $name =\n $class) {\n    $routePlugins-\nsetInvokableClass($name, $class);\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack\n, the \nRoutePluginManager\n is\nset up by default, and the developer does not need to worry about autoloading\nof standard HTTP routes.\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Regex\n\n\nA \nRegex\n route utilizes a regular expression to match against the URI path. Any\nvalid regular expression is allowed; our recommendation is to use named captures\nfor any values you want to return in the \nRouteMatch\n.\n\n\nSince regular expression routes are often complex, you must specify a \"spec\" or\nspecification to use when assembling URLs from regex routes. The spec is simply\na string; replacements are identified using \n%keyname%\n within the string, with\nthe keys coming from either the captured values or named parameters passed to\nthe \nassemble()\n method.\n\n\nJust like other routes, the \nRegex\n route can accept \"defaults\", parameters to\ninclude in the \nRouteMatch\n when successfully matched.\n\n\n$route = Regex::factory([\n    'regex' =\n '/blog/(?\nid\n[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)(\\.(?\nformat\n(json|html|xml|rss)))?',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController',\n        'action'     =\n 'view',\n        'format'     =\n 'html',\n    ],\n    'spec' =\n '/blog/%id%.%format%',\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThe above would match \n/blog/001-some-blog_slug-here.html\n, and return four\nitems in the \nRouteMatch\n, an \"id\", the \"controller\", the \"action\", and the\n\"format\". When assembling a URL from this route, the \"id\" and \"format\" values\nwould be used to fill the specification.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Scheme\n\n\nThe \nScheme\n route matches the URI scheme only, and must be an exact match. As\nsuch, this route, like the \nLiteral\n route, simply takes what you want to match\nand the \"defaults\", parameters to return on a match.\n\n\n$route = Scheme::factory([\n    'scheme' =\n 'https',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'https' =\n true,\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThe above route would match the \"https\" scheme, and return the key \"https\" in\nthe \nRouteMatch\n with a boolean \ntrue\n value.\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Segment\n\n\nA \nSegment\n route allows matching any segment of a URI path. Segments are\ndenoted using a colon, followed by alphanumeric characters; if a segment is\noptional, it should be surrounded by brackets.  As an example, \n/:foo[/:bar]\n\nwould match a \n/\n followed by text and assign it to the key \"foo\"; if any\nadditional \n/\n characters are found, any text following the last one will be\nassigned to the key \"bar\".\n\n\nThe separation between literal and named segments can be anything. For example,\nthe above could be done as \n/:foo{-}[-:bar]\n as well. The \n{-}\n after the \n:foo\n\nparameter indicates a set of one or more delimiters, after which matching of the\nparameter itself ends.\n\n\nEach segment may have constraints associated with it. Each constraint should\nsimply be a regular expression expressing the conditions under which that\nsegment should match.\n\n\nAlso, as you can in other routes, you may provide defaults to use; these are\nparticularly useful when using optional segments.\n\n\nAs a complex example:\n\n\n$route = Segment::factory([\n    'route' =\n '/:controller[/:action]',\n    'constraints' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+',\n        'action'     =\n '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+',\n    ],\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n        'action'     =\n 'index',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Query (Deprecated)\n\n\n\n\nPotential security issue\n\n\nMisuse of this route can lead to potential security issues.\n\n\nDeprecated\n\n\nThis route part is deprecated since you can now add query parameters without a\nquery route.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nQuery\n route part allows you to specify and capture query string parameters\nfor a given route.\n\n\nThe intention of the \nQuery\n part is that you do not instantiate it in its own\nright, but use it as a child of another route part.\n\n\nAn example of its usage would be:\n\n\n$route = Part::factory([\n    'route' =\n [\n        'type'    =\n 'literal',\n        'options' =\n [\n            'route'    =\n 'page',\n            'defaults' =\n [],\n        ],\n    ],\n    'may_terminate' =\n true,\n    'route_plugins' =\n $routePlugins,\n    'child_routes'  =\n [\n        'query' =\n [\n            'type' =\n 'Query',\n            'options' =\n [\n                'defaults' =\n [\n                    'foo' =\n 'bar',\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nThis then allows you to create query strings using the url view helper.\n\n\n$this-\nurl(\n    'page/query',\n    [\n        'name'   =\n 'my-test-page',\n        'format' =\n 'rss',\n        'limit'  =\n 10,\n    ]\n);\n\n\n\n\nPer the above example, you must add \n/query\n (the name we gave to our query\nroute segment) to your route name in order to append a query string. If you do\nnot specify \n/query\n in the route name, then no query string will be appended.\n\n\nOur example \"page\" route has only one defined parameter of \"name\"\n(\n/page[/:name]\n), meaning that the remaining parameters of \"format\" and \"limit\"\nwill then be appended as a query string.\n\n\nThe output from our example should then be\n\n/page/my-test-page?format=rss\nlimit=10\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Wildcard (Deprecated)\n\n\n\n\nPotential security issue\n\n\nMisuse of this route type can lead to potential security issues.\n\n\nDeprecated\n\n\nThis route type is deprecated. Use the \nSegment\n route type.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nWildcard\n route type matches all remaining segments of a URI path.\n\n\nHTTP Routing Examples\n\n\nMost of the routing definitions will be done in module configuration files, so\nthe following examples will show how to set up routes in config files.\n\n\nSimple example with two literal routes\n\n\nreturn [\n    'router' =\n [\n        'routes' =\n [\n            // Literal route named \nhome\n\n            'home' =\n [\n                'type' =\n 'literal',\n                'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n '/',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n                        'action' =\n 'index',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n            // Literal route named \ncontact\n\n            'contact' =\n [\n                'type' =\n 'literal',\n                'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n 'contact',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\ContactController',\n                        'action' =\n 'form',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n\n\n\nA complex example with child routes\n\n\nreturn [\n    'router' =\n [\n        'routes' =\n [\n            // Literal route named \nhome\n\n            'home' =\n [\n                'type' =\n 'literal',\n                'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n '/',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController',\n                        'action' =\n 'index',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n            // Literal route named \nblog\n, with child routes\n            'blog' =\n [\n                'type' =\n 'literal',\n                'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n '/blog',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'controller' =\n 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController',\n                        'action' =\n 'index',\n                    ],\n                ],\n                'may_terminate' =\n true,\n                'child_routes' =\n [\n                    // Segment route for viewing one blog post\n                    'post' =\n [\n                        'type' =\n 'segment',\n                        'options' =\n [\n                            'route' =\n '/[:slug]',\n                            'constraints' =\n [\n                                'slug' =\n '[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+',\n                            ],\n                            'defaults' =\n [\n                                'action' =\n 'view',\n                            ],\n                        ],\n                    ],\n                    // Literal route for viewing blog RSS feed\n                    'rss' =\n [\n                        'type' =\n 'literal',\n                        'options' =\n [\n                            'route' =\n '/rss',\n                            'defaults' =\n [\n                                'action' =\n 'rss',\n                            ],\n                        ],\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n\n\n\nWhen using child routes, naming of the routes follows the \nparent/child\n\npattern, so to use the child routes from the above example:\n\n\necho $this-\nurl('blog');

Typically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt to match the URI\npath segment against provided constraints.

If you do\nnot specify  /query  in the route name, then no query string will be appended.  Our example \"page\" route has only one defined parameter of \"name\"\n( /page[/:name] ), meaning that the remaining parameters of \"format\" and \"limit\"\nwill then be appended as a query string.

This event is created during  Zend\\Mvc\\Application::bootstrap() \nand is passed when triggering all application events.  Additionally, if your\ncontrollers implement the  Zend\\Mvc\\InjectApplicationEventInterface ,  MvcEvent \nwill be injected into those controllers.  The  MvcEvent  adds accessors and mutators for the following:   Application  object.  Request  object.  Response  object.  Router  object.  RouteMatch  object.  Result - usually the result of dispatching a controller.  ViewModel  object, typically representing the layout view model.   The methods it defines are:   setApplication($application)  getApplication()  setRequest($request)  getRequest()  setResponse($response)  getResponse()  setRouter($router)  getRouter()  setRouteMatch($routeMatch)  getRouteMatch()  setResult($result)  getResult()  setViewModel($viewModel)  getViewModel()  isError()  setError()  getError()  getController()  setController($name)  getControllerClass()  setControllerClass($class)   The  Application ,  Request ,  Response ,  Router , and  ViewModel  are all\ninjected during the  bootstrap  event. Following the  route  event, it will be\ninjected also with the  RouteMatch  object encapsulating the results of routing.  Since this object is passed around throughout the MVC, it is a common location\nfor retrieving the results of routing, the router, and the request and response\nobjects.

Examples include forms, paginators,\nnavigation, etc. In these cases, you may decide that it doesn't make sense to\ninject those objects every time the controller is used.\n\n\nThe \nServiceLocatorAwareInterface\n interface hints to the \nServiceManager\n that it should inject\nitself into the controller.

We recommend injecting dependencies explicitly instead of\npulling them from a composed \nServiceManager\n instance.\n\n\nIn cases where an object will not be used in all code paths, we recommend\nsplitting into discrete controllers, or using \nlazy services\n.\n\n\n\n\nEventManagerAware\n\n\nTypically, it's nice to be able to tie into a controller's workflow without\nneeding to extend it or hardcode behavior into it. The solution for this is to\nuse the \nEventManager\n.\n\n\nYou can hint to the \nServiceManager\n that you want an \nEventManager\n injected by\nimplementing the interface \nEventManagerAwareInterface\n, which tells the\n\nServiceManager\n to inject an \nEventManager\n.\n\n\nTo do this, you define two methods.

Another common goal is convenience.\nHowever, this is often difficult to achieve cleanly in abstract, general\nsystems.\n\n\nWithin your controllers, you'll often find yourself repeating tasks from one\ncontroller to another.  Some common examples:\n\n\n\n\nGenerating URLs.\n\n\nRedirecting.\n\n\nSetting and retrieving flash messages (self-expiring session messages).\n\n\nInvoking and dispatching additional controllers.\n\n\n\n\nTo facilitate these actions while also making them available to alternate\ncontroller implementations, we've created a \nPluginManager\n implementation for\nthe controller layer, \nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\PluginManager\n, building on the\n\nZend\\ServiceManager\\AbstractPluginManager\n functionality. To utilize it,\nimplement the \nsetPluginManager(PluginManager $plugins)\n method, and set up your\ncode to use the controller-specific implementation by default:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\PluginManager;\n\npublic function setPluginManager(PluginManager $plugins)\n{\n    $this-\nplugins = $plugins;\n    $this-\nplugins-\nsetController($this);\n\n    return $this;\n}\n\npublic function getPluginManager()\n{\n    if (!$this-\nplugins) {\n        $this-\nsetPluginManager(new PluginManager());\n    }\n\n    return $this-\nplugins;\n}\n\npublic function plugin($name, array $options = null)\n{\n    return $this-\ngetPluginManager()-\nget($name, $options);\n}\n\n\n\n\nAbstractActionController\n\n\nImplementing each of the above interfaces is a lesson in redundancy; you won't\noften want to do it.  As such, we've developed abstract, base controllers you\ncan extend to get started.\n\n\nThe first is \nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController\n. This controller\nimplements each of the above interfaces, and uses the following assumptions:\n\n\n\n\nAn \"action\" parameter is expected in the \nRouteMatch\n object composed in the\n  attached \nMvcEvent\n.  If none is found, a \nnotFoundAction()\n is invoked.\n\n\nThe \"action\" parameter is converted to a camelCased format and appended with\n  the word \"Action\" to create a method name. As examples: \"foo\" maps to\n  \nfooAction\n, \"foo-bar\" or \"foo.bar\" or \"foo_bar\" to \nfooBarAction\n. The\n  controller then checks to see if that method exists. If not, the\n  \nnotFoundAction()\n method is invoked; otherwise, the discovered method is\n  called.\n\n\nThe results of executing the given action method are injected into the\n  \nMvcEvent\n's \"result\" property (via \nsetResult()\n, and accessible via\n  \ngetResult()\n).\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, a route mapping to an \nAbstractActionController\n needs to return\nboth the \"controller\" and \"action\" keys in its matches.\n\n\nCreation of action controllers looks like the following example:\n\n\nnamespace Foo\\Controller;\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController;\n\nclass BarController extends AbstractActionController\n{\n    public function bazAction()\n    {\n        return ['title' =\n __METHOD__];\n    }\n\n    public function batAction()\n    {\n        return ['title' =\n __METHOD__];\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nInterfaces and Collaborators\n\n\nAbstractActionController\n implements each of the following interfaces:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\InjectApplicationEventInterface\n\n\nZend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface\n (starting with zend-mvc\n  2.7.0, only the methods defined by the interface, not the interface itself)\n\n\nZend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface\n\n\n\n\nThe composed \nEventManager\n will be configured to listen on the following contexts:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractController\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you extend the class, it will listen on the name of the\nextending class.\n\n\nAbstractRestfulController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractRestfulController\n provides a native RESTful\nimplementation that maps HTTP request methods to controller methods, using the\nfollowing matrix:\n\n\n\n\nGET\n maps to either \nget()\n or \ngetList()\n, depending on whether or not an\n  \"id\" parameter is found in the route matches. If one is, it is passed as an\n  argument to \nget()\n; if not, \ngetList()\n is invoked. In the former case, you\n  should provide a representation of the given entity with that identification;\n  in the latter, you should provide a list of entities.\n\n\nPOST\n maps to \ncreate()\n. That method expects a \n$data\n argument, usually\n  the \n$_POST\n superglobal array. The data should be used to create a new\n  entity, and the response should typically be an HTTP 201 response with the\n  Location header indicating the URI of the newly created entity and the\n  response body providing the representation.\n\n\nPUT\n maps to \nupdate()\n, and requires that an \"id\" parameter exists in the\n  route matches; that value is passed as an argument to the method. It should\n  attempt to update the given entity, and, if successful, return either a 200 or\n  202 response status, as well as the representation of the entity.\n\n\nDELETE\n maps to \ndelete()\n, and requires that an \"id\" parameter exists in\n  the route matches; that value is passed as an argument to the method. It\n  should attempt to delete the given entity, and, if successful, return either a\n  200 or 204 response status.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can map \"action\" methods to the \nAbstractRestfulController\n,\njust as you would in the \nAbstractActionController\n; these methods will be\nsuffixed with \"Action\", differentiating them from the RESTful methods listed\nabove. This allows you to perform such actions as providing forms used to submit\nto the various RESTful methods, or to add RPC methods to your RESTful API.\n\n\nInterfaces and Collaborators\n\n\nAbstractRestfulController\n implements each of the following interfaces:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\InjectApplicationEventInterface\n\n\nZend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface\n (starting with zend-mvc\n  2.7.0, only the methods defined by the interface, not the interface itself)\n\n\nZend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface\n\n\n\n\nThe composed \nEventManager\n will be configured to listen on the following contexts:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractRestfulController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractController\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you extend the class, it will listen on the name of the\nextending class.\n\n\nAbstractConsoleController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractConsoleController\n extends from \nAbstractActionController\n\nand provides the following functionality:\n\n\n\n\nThe method \nsetConsole(Zend\\Console\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface $console)\n allows\n  injecting a console adapter representing the current console environment. By\n  default, the \nControllerManager\n will inject this for you as part of\n  controller instantiation.\n\n\nThe method \ngetConsole()\n allows you to retrieve the current console adapter\n  instance, allowing you to retrieve console capabilities and generate console\n  output.\n\n\nThe \ndispatch()\n method will throw an exception if invoked in a non-console\n  environment, ensuring that you do not need to do any checks within your action\n  methods for the environment.\n\n\n\n\nInterfaces and Collaborators\n\n\nAbstractRestfulController\n implements each of the following interfaces:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\InjectApplicationEventInterface\n\n\nZend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface\n (starting with zend-mvc\n  2.7.0, only the methods defined by the interface, not the interface itself)\n\n\nZend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface\n\n\n\n\nThe composed \nEventManager\n will be configured to listen on the following contexts:\n\n\n\n\nZend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractConsoleController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController\n\n\nZend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractController\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you extend the class, it will listen on the name of the\nextending class.",

For example, you might use this approach to build up\n\"widgetized\" content. The \nForward\n plugin helps enable this.\n\n\nFor the \nForward\n plugin to work, the controller calling it must be\n\nServiceLocatorAware\n; otherwise, the plugin will be unable to retrieve a\nconfigured and injected instance of the requested controller.\n\n\nThe plugin exposes a single method, \ndispatch()\n, which takes two arguments:\n\n\n\n\n$name\n, the name of the controller to invoke. This may be either the fully\n  qualified class name, or an alias defined and recognized by the\n  \nServiceManager\n instance attached to the invoking controller.\n\n\n$params\n is an optional array of parameters with which to seed a \nRouteMatch\n\n  object for purposes of this specific request. Meaning the parameters will be\n  matched by their key to the routing identifiers in the config (otherwise\n  non-matching keys are ignored)\n\n\n\n\nForward\n returns the results of dispatching the requested controller; it is up\nto the developer to determine what, if anything, to do with those results. One\nrecommendation is to aggregate them in any return value from the invoking\ncontroller.\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\n$foo = $this-\nforward()-\ndispatch('foo', ['action' =\n 'process']);\nreturn [\n    'somekey' =\n $somevalue,\n    'foo'     =\n $foo,\n];\n\n\n\n\nIdentity Plugin\n\n\nThe \nIdentity\n plugin allows retrieving the identity from the\n\nAuthenticationService\n.\n\n\nFor the \nIdentity\n plugin to work, a \nZend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService\n\nname or alias must be defined and recognized by the \nServiceManager\n.\n\n\nIdentity\n returns the identity in the \nAuthenticationService\n or \nnull\n if no\nidentity is available.\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\npublic function testAction()\n{\n    if ($user = $this-\nidentity()) {\n         // someone is logged !\n    } else {\n         // not logged in\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen invoked, the \nIdentity\n plugin will look for a service by the name or alias\n\nZend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService\n in the \nServiceManager\n. You can\nprovide this service to the \nServiceManager\n in a configuration file:\n\n\n// In a configuration file...\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService;\n\nreturn [\n    'service_manager' =\n [\n        'aliases' =\n [\n            AuthenticationService::class =\n 'my_auth_service',\n        ],\n        'invokables' =\n [\n            'my_auth_service' =\n AuthenticationService::class,\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n\n\n\nThe \nIdentity\n plugin exposes two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetAuthenticationService(AuthenticationService $authenticationService) : void\n:\n  Sets the authentication service instance to be used by the plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngetAuthenticationService() : AuthenticationService\n: Retrieves the current\n  authentication service instance if any is attached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayout Plugin\n\n\nThe \nLayout\n plugin allows changing layout templates from within controller actions.\n\n\nIt exposes a single method, \nsetTemplate()\n, which takes one argument,\n\n$template\n, the name of the template to set.\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\n$this-\nlayout()-\nsetTemplate('layout/newlayout');\n\n\n\n\nIt also implements the \n__invoke\n magic method, which allows calling the plugin\nas a method call:\n\n\n$this-\nlayout('layout/newlayout');\n\n\n\n\nParams Plugin\n\n\nThe \nParams\n plugin allows accessing parameters in actions from different sources.\n\n\nIt exposes several methods, one for each parameter source:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromFiles(string $name = null, mixed $default = null): array|ArrayAccess|null\n:\n  For retrieving all or one single \nfile\n. If \n$name\n is null, all files will\n  be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromHeader(string $header = null, mixed $default = null) : null|Zend\\Http\\Header\\HeaderInterface\n:\n  For retrieving all or one single \nheader\n parameter. If \n$header\n is null,\n  all header parameters will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromPost(string $param = null, mixed $default = null) : mixed\n: For\n  retrieving all or one single \npost\n parameter. If \n$param\n is null, all post\n  parameters will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromQuery(string $param = null, mixed $default = null) : mixed\n: For\n  retrieving all or one single \nquery\n parameter. If \n$param\n is null, all\n  query parameters will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfromRoute(string $param = null, mixed $default = null) : mixed\n: For\n  retrieving all or one single \nroute\n parameter. If \n$param\n is null, all\n  route parameters will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plugin also implements the \n__invoke\n magic method, providing a shortcut\nfor invoking the \nfromRoute\n method:\n\n\n$this-\nparams()-\nfromRoute('param', $default);\n// or\n$this-\nparams('param', $default);\n\n\n\n\nPost/Redirect/Get Plugin\n\n\nWhen a user sends a POST request (e.g. after submitting a form), their browser\nwill try to protect them from sending the POST again, breaking the back button,\ncausing browser warnings and pop-ups, and sometimes reposting the form. Instead,\nwhen receiving a POST, we should store the data in a session container and\nredirect the user to a GET request.\n\n\nThis plugin can be invoked with two arguments:\n\n\n\n\n$redirect\n, a string containing the redirect location, which can either be a\n  named route or a URL, based on the contents of the second parameter.\n\n\n$redirectToUrl\n, a boolean that when set to \nTRUE\n, causes the first\n  parameter to be treated as a URL instead of a route name (this is required\n  when redirecting to a URL instead of a route). This argument defaults to\n  \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen no arguments are provided, the current matched route is used.\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n\n// Pass in the route/url you want to redirect to after the POST\n$prg = $this-\nprg('/user/register', true);\n\nif ($prg instanceof \\Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response) {\n    // Returned a response to redirect us.\n    return $prg;\n}\n\nif ($prg === false) {\n    // This wasn't a POST request, but there were no params in the flash\n    // messenger; this is probably the first time the form was loaded.\n    return ['form' =\n $myForm];\n}\n\n// $prg is an array containing the POST params from the previous request\n$form-\nsetData($prg);\n\n// ... your form processing code here\n\n\n\n\nFile Post/Redirect/Get Plugin\n\n\nWhile similar to the \nPost/Redirect/Get Plugin\n,\nthe File PRG Plugin will work for forms with file inputs. The difference is in\nthe behavior: The File PRG Plugin will interact directly with your form instance\nand the file inputs, rather than \nonly\n returning the POST params from the\nprevious request.\n\n\nBy interacting directly with the form, the File PRG Plugin will turn off any\nfile inputs \nrequired\n flags for already uploaded files (for a partially valid\nform state), as well as run the file input filters to move the uploaded files\ninto a new location (configured by the user).\n\n\n\n\nFiles must be relocated on upload\n\n\nYou \nmust\n attach a filter for moving the uploaded files to a new location, such as the\n\nRenameUpload Filter\n,\nor else your files will be removed upon the redirect.\n\n\n\n\nThis plugin is invoked with three arguments:\n\n\n\n\n$form\n: the form instance.\n\n\n$redirect\n: (Optional) a string containing the redirect location, which can\n  either be a named route or a URL, based on the contents of the third\n  parameter. If this argument is not provided, it will default to the current\n  matched route.\n\n\n$redirectToUrl\n: (Optional) a boolean that when set to \nTRUE\n, causes the\n  second parameter to be treated as a URL instead of a route name (this is\n  required when redirecting to a URL instead of a route). This argument defaults\n  to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n\n$myForm = new Zend\\Form\\Form('my-form');\n$myForm-\nadd([\n    'type' =\n 'Zend\\Form\\Element\\File',\n    'name' =\n 'file',\n]);\n\n// NOTE: Without a filter to move the file,\n//       our files will disappear between the requests\n$myForm-\ngetInputFilter()-\ngetFilterChain()-\nattach(\n    new Zend\\Filter\\File\\RenameUpload([\n        'target'    =\n './data/tmpuploads/file',\n        'randomize' =\n true,\n    ])\n);\n\n// Pass in the form and optional the route/url you want to redirect to after the POST\n$prg = $this-\nfileprg($myForm, '/user/profile-pic', true);\n\nif ($prg instanceof \\Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response) {\n    // Returned a response to redirect us.\n    return $prg;\n}\n\nif ($prg === false) {\n    // First time the form was loaded.\n    return array('form' =\n $myForm);\n}\n\n// Form was submitted.\n// $prg is now an array containing the POST params from the previous request,\n// but we don't have to apply it to the form since that has already been done.\n\n// Process the form\nif ($form-\nisValid()) {\n    // ...Save the form...\n    return $this-\nredirect()-\ntoRoute('/user/profile-pic/success');\n}\n\n// Form not valid, but file uploads might be valid and uploaded\n$fileErrors = $form-\nget('file')-\ngetMessages();\nif (empty($fileErrors)) {\n    $tempFile = $form-\nget('file')-\ngetValue();\n}\n\n\n\n\nRedirect Plugin\n\n\nRedirections are quite common operations within applications. If done manually,\nyou will need to do the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nAssemble a url using the router.\n\n\nCreate and inject a \"Location\" header into the \nResponse\n object, pointing to\n  the assembled URL.\n\n\nSet the status code of the \nResponse\n object to one of the 3xx HTTP statuses.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRedirect\n plugin does this work for you. It offers three methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoRoute(string $route = null, array $params = array(), array $options = array(), boolean $reuseMatchedParams = false) : Zend\\Http\\Response\n:\n  Redirects to a named route, using the provided \n$params\n and \n$options\n to\n  assembled the URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoUrl(string $url) : Zend\\Http\\Response\n: Simply redirects to the given URL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrefresh() : Zend\\Http\\Response\n: Refresh to current route.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each case, the \nResponse\n object is returned. If you return this immediately,\nyou can effectively short-circuit execution of the request.\n\n\n\n\nRequires MvcEvent\n\n\nThis plugin requires that the controller invoking it implements\n\nInjectApplicationEventInterface\n, and thus has an \nMvcEvent\n composed, as it\nretrieves the router from the event object.\n\n\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\nreturn $this-\nredirect()-\ntoRoute('login-success');\n\n\n\n\nUrl Plugin\n\n\nYou may need to generate URLs from route definitions within your controllers;\nfor example, to seed the view, generate headers, etc. While the \nMvcEvent\n\nobject composes the router, doing so manually would require this workflow:\n\n\n$router = $this-\ngetEvent()-\ngetRouter();\n$url    = $router-\nassemble($params, ['name' =\n 'route-name']);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nUrl\n helper makes this slightly more convenient:\n\n\n$url = $this-\nurl()-\nfromRoute('route-name', $params);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfromRoute()\n method is the only public method defined, and is used to\ngenerate a URL string from the provided parameters. It has the following\nsignature:\n\n\n\n\nfromRoute(string $route = null, array $params = [], array $options = [], bool $reuseMatchedParams = false): string\n, where:\n\n\n$name\n: the name of the route to use for URL generation.\n\n\n$params\n: Any parameter substitutions to use with the named route.\n\n\n$options\n: Options used by the router when generating the URL (e.g., \nforce_canonical\n, \nquery\n, etc.).\n\n\n$reuseMatchedParams\n: Whether or not to use route match parameters from the\n    current URL when generating the new URL. This will only affect cases where\n    the specified \n$name\n matches the currently matched route; the default is\n    \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires MvcEvent\n\n\nThis plugin requires that the controller invoking it implements\n\nInjectApplicationEventInterface\n, and thus has an \nMvcEvent\n composed, as it\nretrieves the router from the event object.",

This may be either the fully\n  qualified class name, or an alias defined and recognized by the\n   ServiceManager  instance attached to the invoking controller.  $params  is an optional array of parameters with which to seed a  RouteMatch \n  object for purposes of this specific request.

One\nrecommendation is to aggregate them in any return value from the invoking\ncontroller.  As an example:  $foo = $this- forward()- dispatch('foo', ['action' =  'process']);\nreturn [\n    'somekey' =  $somevalue,\n    'foo'     =  $foo,\n];",

This looks like any other\n\nrouting\n configuration, with one small change: instead of providing\na \"controller\" in the routing defaults, you provide \"middleware\":\n\n\n// Via configuration:\nreturn [\n    'router' =\n\n        'routes' =\n [\n            'home' =\n [\n                'type' =\n 'literal',\n                'options' =\n [\n                    'route' =\n '/',\n                    'defaults' =\n [\n                        'middleware' =\n 'Application\\Middleware\\IndexMiddleware',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n];\n\n// Manually:\n$route = Literal::factory([\n    'route' =\n '/',\n    'defaults' =\n [\n        'middleware' =\n 'Application\\Middleware\\IndexMiddleware',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nMiddleware may be provided as PHP callables, or as service names.\n\n\n\n\nNo action required\n\n\nUnlike action controllers, middleware typically is single purpose, and, as\nsuch, does require a default \naction\n parameter.\n\n\n\n\nMiddleware services\n\n\nIn a normal zend-mvc dispatch cycle, controllers are pulled from a dedicated\n\nControllerManager\n. Middleware, however, are pulled from the application\nservice manager.\n\n\nMiddleware retrieved \nmust\n be PHP callables. The \nMiddlewareListener\n will\ncreate an error response if non-callable middleware is indicated.\n\n\nWriting middleware\n\n\nWhen dispatching middleware, the \nMiddlewareListener\n calls it with two\narguments, the PSR-7 request and response, respectively. As such, your\nmiddleware signature should look like the following:\n\n\nnamespace Application\\Middleware;\n\nuse Psr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface;\nuse Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface;\n\nclass IndexMiddleware\n{\n    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)\n    {\n        // do some work\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, you can pull information from the composed request, and manipulate\nthe response.\n\n\n\n\nRouting parameters\n\n\nAt the time of the 2.7.0 release, route match parameters are not yet injected\ninto the PSR-7 \nServerRequest\n instance, and are thus not available as request\nattributes..\n\n\n\n\nMiddleware return values\n\n\nIdeally, your middleware should return a PSR-7 response. When it does, it is\nconverted back to a zend-http response and returned by the \nMiddlewareListener\n,\ncausing the application to short-circuit and return the response immediately.\n\n\nYou can, however, return arbitrary values. If you do, the result is pushed into\nthe \nMvcEvent\n as the event result, allowing later dispatch listeners to\nmanipulate the results.",
