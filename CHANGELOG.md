# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 2.7.0 - TBD

### Added

- [#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/31) adds three new
  optional arguments to the `Zend\Mvc\Application` constructor: an EventManager
  instance, a Request instance, and a Response instance.
- [#36](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/36) adds more than a
  dozen service factories, primarily to separate conditional factories into
  discrete factories.
- [#32](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/32) adds
  `Zend\Mvc\MiddlewareListener`, which allows dispatching PSR-7-based middleware
  implementing the signature `function (ServerRequestInterface $request,
  ResponseInterface $response)`. To dispatch such middleware, point the
  `middleware` "default" for a given route to a service name or callable that
  will resolve to the middleware:

  ```php
  [ 'router' => 'routes' => [
      'path' => [
          'type' => 'Literal',
          'options' => [
              'route' => '/path',
              'defaults' => [
                  'middleware' => 'ServiceNameForPathMiddleware',
              ],
          ],
      ],
  ]
  ```

  This new listener listens at the same priority as the `DispatchListener`, but,
  due to being registered earlier, will invoke first; if the route match does
  not resolve to middleware, it will fall through to the original
  `DispatchListener`, allowing normal ZF2-style controller dispatch.

### Deprecated

- Two initializers registered by `Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig` are now
  deprecated, and will be removed starting in version 3.0:
  - `ServiceManagerAwareInitializer`, which injects classes implementing
    `Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManagerAwareInterface` with the service manager
    instance. Users should create factories for such classes that directly
    inject their dependencies instead.
  - `ServiceLocatorAwareInitializer`, which injects classes implementing
    `Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface` with the service manager
    instance. Users should create factories for such classes that directly
    inject their dependencies instead.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/31) and
  [#76](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/76) update the component
  to be forwards-compatible with zend-eventmanager v3.
- [#36](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/36) and
  [#76](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/76) update the component
  to be forwards-compatible with zend-servicemanager v3. Several changes were
  introduced to support this effort:
  - Added a `RouteInvokableFactory`, which can act as either a
    `FactoryInterface` or `AbstractFactoryInterface` for loading invokable route
    classes, including by fully qualified class name. This is registered as an
    abstract factory by default with the `RoutePluginManager`.
  - The `DispatchListener` now receives the controller manager instance at
    instantiation.
  - The `ViewManager` implementations were updated, and most functionality
    within separated into discrete factories.

## 2.6.4 - TBD

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 2.6.3 - 2016-02-23

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#74](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/74) fixes the
  `FormAnnotationBuilderFactory`'s usage of the
  `FormElementManager::injectFactory()` method to ensure it works correctly on
  all versions.

## 2.6.2 - 2016-02-22

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#71](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/71) fixes the
  `ViewHelperManagerFactory` to be backwards-compatible with v2 by ensuring that
  the factories for each of the `url`, `basepath`, and `doctype` view helpers
  are registered using the fully qualified class names present in
  `Zend\View\HelperPluginManager`; these changes ensure requests for these
  helpers resolve to these override factories, instead of the
  `InvokableFactory`.

## 2.6.1 - 2016-02-16

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#69](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/69) largely reverts
  [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/30), having the component
  utilize the `HydratorPluginManager` from zend-stdlib 2.7.5. This was done to
  provide backwards compatibility; while zend-stdlib Hydrator types can be used
  in place of zend-hydrator types, the reverse is not true.

  You can make your code forwards-compatible with version 3, where the
  `HydratorPluginManager` will be pulled from zend-hydrator, by updating your
  typehints to use the zend-hydrator classes instead of those from zend-stdlib;
  the instances returned from the zend-stdlib `HydratorPluginManager`, because
  they extend those from zend-hydrator, remain compatible. 

## 2.6.0 - 2015-09-22

### Added

- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/30) updates the component
  to use zend-hydrator for hydrator functionality; this provides forward
  compatibility with zend-hydrator, and backwards compatibility with
  hydrators from older versions of zend-stdlib.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 2.5.3 - 2015-09-22

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/29) updates the
  zend-stdlib dependency to reference `>=2.5.0,<2.7.0` to ensure hydrators
  will work as expected following extraction of hydrators to the zend-hydrator
  repository.

## 2.5.2 - 2015-09-14

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/pull/27) fixes a condition
  where non-view model results from controllers could cause errors to be
  raisedin the `DefaultRenderingStrategy`.
